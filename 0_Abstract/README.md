   # MONITORING SYSTEM OF WATER LEVEL

## Abstract

 A Monitoring system of water level  is used to detect and monitor the water level in an overhead tank or any other water container.
 In this project, I implemented the design of a water level sensor device using Atmega 328p this can detect the level of water in a water storage                         system.
 An ultrasonic sensor is used to generate ultrasonic waves.
 A water sensor to detect the water level.LEDs to signify the importance of different water levels.
 Display is  to observe the levels of water.     
I indicated a green LED for safe water level, one red LED for about to reach max level and two red LEDs for maximum water level.
This circuit is efficient and can be used for any application involving the levels of any liquid.
