The water level in an overhead tank or any other water container is detected and monitored using a water level monitoring system.
In this project, I designed a water level sensor device that can detect the amount of water in a water storage system using an Atmega 328p.
Ultrasonic waves are generated using an ultrasonic sensor.
A water sensor that detects the level of water.
LEDs are used to indicate the relevance of various water levels. The purpose of the display is to keep track of the water levels.
A green LED showed a safe water level, one red LED indicated that the water level was approaching maximum, and two red LEDs indicated that the water level had reached maximum.
This circuit is effective and can be utilised in a variety of applications.
