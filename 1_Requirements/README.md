# MONITORING SYSTEM OF WATER LEVEL

# INTRODUCTION 

Water is essential in our daily lives. One of the most crucial parameters for any household is the availability of water in the tank.
Device must turn on the motor if the water level in the tank is too low. If the level rises too high, the Device must shut down the motor. 
Because water is so important, if the level is abnormal, it causes everyday household chores to be disrupted. 
As a result, we must continually manage the Water level.

# Applications

1) Save Power:  In an era of energy conservation, these devices are very beneficial to save energy.
               Hence electrical power wastage can be reduced. 
               These sensor control water levels and minimize the usage of electricity.
2) Automatically works:  These sensors can work automatically when connected to timer devices.
3) These are low cost and easy to install devices
4) The design is compact and with low maintenance and cam clearly indicate the water levels in the overhead tank
5) AS they can be fully automatic, they save time and avoid seepage of roofs and walls due to overflowing tanks.
6) These sensors take less energy and can be used for continuous operation

## Strength 
       It has a small size yet great strength.The actual Water Level is displayed accurately.Motor control that is fully automated.
       It's inexpensive.
       
## Weakness
       We must be very careful in establishing a Water-resistant environment since electrical components are used in a Water Reserve.
       
## Opportunities
         We should provide an opportunity for everyone to utilise our product by raising awareness about water and 
         electricity waste as a result of insufficient user attention, as well as the significance of closely monitoring 
         the motor for maximum safety.Water is currently required everywhere on the planet due to the current water scarcity.
         
## Threat
        In the Water level Monitoring area, there are numerous new developing gadgets now for competitiveness.
        
        
 ## 4W'S and 1H
 
 ### HOW?
      Basically, in this project sensor plays a major role.It detects the signal and transmits the output of the following code.
 ### WHY?
     it is critical for everyone to understand the importance of water conservation, so gadgets like ours will serve as 
     a first step towards saving water and power in every household.
 ### WHO?
     Because it's an automatic detector, there's no need for any manual intervention to return it to its original state,
     allowing anyone who needs it to utilise it.
 
 ### WHAT?
    It's a motor control project that monitors the water level in the tank and notifies the user of the level and motor state.
